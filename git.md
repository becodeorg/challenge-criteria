# Criteria - Git & GitHub

- [ ] I committed at least twice per day.
- [ ] I pushed to the remote at least once per day.
- [ ] I used only relevant commit messages. (The messages explain the commits.)
- [ ] I made a branch that only I developed on. (In group projects this means that everyone created their own branch.)
- [ ] I published the result of the challenge on GitHub using GitHub pages.
- [ ] I wrote a well-structured `README.md` that explains the challenge and how I approached it. The `README.md` also contains documentation on how the website works and a link to the live version.
