# Criteria - HTML


- [ ] I used the correct `lang` attribute on the HTML tag.
- [ ] I added a complete and descriptive `alt` attribute to every image.
- [ ] I only used the `<br>` tag to create a linebreak within an element. Not between two elements.
- [ ] I added an accompanying `<label>` for every `<input>` and linked them accordingly.
- [ ] I protected my users against tabnabbing (an exploit).
- [ ] I did not use any deprecated HTML tags.
- [ ] There are no unnecessary tags.
- [ ] I used meaningful (read: semantically correct) HTML5 tags.
- [ ] Separation of concerns: I did not add any styling nor scripting in the HTML file(s).
- [ ] I tested my website with a markup validator ([example][1]).
- [ ] ID attributes are not used more than once in the same document. 
- [ ] DOM elements that are linked to Javascript manipulation are prefixed with `js-*`. 
- [ ] I tested that my website shows all the content properly with an adblocker enabled. 
- [ ] I added the relevant OpenGraph metadata.
